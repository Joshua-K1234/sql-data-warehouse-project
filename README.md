# Data Warehouse Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **data warehouse** to store and analyze business data efficiently. It includes an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** to ingest and process data from two CSV files and provides analytical insights using SQL Server.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Centralized Data Storage**: Store structured data in a well-defined schema.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Automate data extraction, transformation, and loading from CSV sources.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Enable business users to run SQL queries and generate insights.
- **Scalability**: Optimize performance within SQL Server.
