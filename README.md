# Data Warehouse Project

## 📌 Project Overview
- Business Problem: A company has csv files that need to be used for analysis:
- How I plan on Solving the Problem:
This project implements a **data warehouse** to store business data efficiently for 6 csv files using SQL Server. It includes an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** to ingest and process data from six CSV files and provides views that are suitable for analysis and informed decision-making.
